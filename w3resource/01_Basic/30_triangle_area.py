A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. 
It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. 
A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted triangle ABC.

Vertex of a triangle: The point at which two sides of a triangle meet.
Altitude of a triangle: The perpendicular segment from a vertex of a triangle to the line containing the opposite side.
Base of a triangle: The side of a triangle to which an altitude is drawn.
Height of a triangle: The length of an altitude.

Formulas : A = 1/2 × b × h.
