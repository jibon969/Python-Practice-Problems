"""
Let us discuss the formula for compound interest. The formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by:

A = P(1 + R/100) t

Compound Interest = A â€“ P

Where,
A is amount
P is the principal amount
R is the rate and
T is the time span

Input: Principal (amount): 1200, Time: 2, Rate: 5.4
